   Summary
   -------

   This module defines an object that assists the loading of the library.
   This is done in four steps:
   	1. create a thread
   	2. in that thread, blocking wait until the target application has started
   	3. wait for the application event loop has started
   	4. create the TCP server that listens for requests
